    <p>It all started when I   was young that I was able to travel the world and live in many different places. This has made me an adventure seeker, a foodie and a travel expert. In the past few years I have been flying for free and on first class all thanks to credit card points. I started this in 2013 and since there has been mass devaluations and it has been becoming more challenging.
    <p>With all the adventures I have done, I have wanted to blog and keep a record of my past. Now that I am programming, I am able to expand on my website and create new opportunities.</p>
